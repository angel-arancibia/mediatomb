Why?
----

Because Meaditomb is amaizing but a bit out of date, and became a pain in the ass to compile against current version of gcc and libraries.

How?
----

Well, we will start from the last release code (0.12.1) from 2010, apply a bunk of patchs that are arround the net, in order to get it compile under new version of gcc, mp4v2 and all that things. 

After that we will playing arround.

See you there!
